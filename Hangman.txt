What needs to happen to show a word with underscores as letters first and then replace each underscore with a guessed letter?

- Print a random word from the list and hide it,
- Replace the letters with underscores and show it to the user,
- Print instruction for the user to know how many guesses he has and to start playing by choosing a letter,
- Check if the letter chosen by the user is whithin the word, if so replace underscore by the letter and ask the user to guess again,
- Until the user is out of guesses or until he find the word keep printing how many guesses the user have left.
